# `light-pipe`

`light-pipe` is currently under construction. It is a Python framework designed to facilitate the deployment of geospatial data pipelines at scale. It will provide a platform-agnostic API for efficient ETL with cloud-optimized geotiffs, and allow for model training with heterogeneous geospatial data sources and formats. It will also handle task scheduling and queuing to facilitate distributed processing of geospatial data, and facilitate data ingest from major data providers.
