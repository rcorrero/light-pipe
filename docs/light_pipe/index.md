## Overview

[Light-Pipe](https://www.light-pipe.io/) is an extensible, light-weight Python framework for data pipelines that scale. It provides a set of intuitive abstractions designed to decouple pipeline implementation from the operations performed within the pipeline. It is designed to scale effortlessly, being built from the ground-up to support concurrency in all its forms, and it has zero non-standard dependencies. Light-Pipe is released under a [BSD-3-Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).
